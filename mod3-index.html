            <h3 id="p1">Biryani</h3>
            <p>A world-renowned Indian dish, biryani takes time and practice to make but is worth every bit of the
                effort. Long-grained rice (like basmati) flavored with fragrant spices such as saffron and layered with
                lamb, chicken, fish, or vegetables and a thick gravy. The dish is then covered, its lid secured with
                dough, and then the biryani is cooked over a low flame. This is definitely a special occasion dish.
                There is much debate of how this dish came to be, but most agree that its origins began in Persia as a
                rustic rice-and-meat dish and then traveled to India. The various recipes of biryani were then born,
                mainly where there was culinary influence from Muslim foods, particularly in the city of Hyderabad in
                south India, but also along the southern coast. Biryani's many, many variations depend on where the dish
                is based. Some differences are subtle while others are distinguished by added or substituted
                ingredients.
                The main components of this dish are rice, meat, marinade, and spices. Basmati rice is definitely
                prevalent, but you will also find other grains such as seeraga samba and jeerakasala. Depending on where
                the biryani is from will determine the type of protein; coastal regions, for example, will include fish
                and shrimp, while inland areas may incorporate chicken, goat, mutton, and beef (mainly buffalo, but if
                cow, would be outside of India).
                The meat is usually marinated before being cooked, and the most common marinade is yogurt-spiced based
                as the acid in the yogurt helps to tenderize the meat. It is the layers of spices that give a biryani
                its complex flavor, and these spices can be whole or ground, or individual or a spice mix (such as garam
                masala). Herbs and seeds may also be a part of the dish, which is often topped with caramelized onion,
                dried or fresh fruit, nuts, and fresh herbs.

            <h3 id="p1">Pani Puri</h3>
            <p>Panipuri or fuchka fhuchka or gupchup or golgappa or Pani ke Patake is a type of snack that
                originated in the Indian subcontinent,
                and is one of the most common street foods in Indian subcontinent.Fuchka (or fuska or puska) differs
                from Panipuri in content and taste. It uses spiced mashed potatoes as the filling.
                It is tangy rather than sweetish while the water is sour and spicy.
                A person serving pani puri would take tiny-sized rounded pani puri and break it from the center through
                the point of the finger and stuff it with white boiled chickpeas and fill spicy water.
                They will also put onion, mint, Tamarind chutney, chat masala, potatoes, and chilies inside it for
                making it more spicy and tasty to eat. They are cheaply available to buy and eat.
                Panipuri is a street snack that is extremely popular in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal. Small in
                size, it consists of a hollow puri that is fried until crispy, then stuffed with a combination of
                flavored water called pani, tamarind chutney, chaat masala, potatoes, onions, hot chillis, and
                chickpeas.Pani Puri is also called by Puckha by some of the people. It is a cold snack with a sour taste
                of water made with a mixture of so many spices that add taste to it. It could be generally found nearby
                on thelas.

                value and the least quantity of sodium in 1 percent only.
                A single pani puri comprises an of total 329 calories in a spectrum of 207 calories of 38 calories in
                proteins and 82 calories of fat. Each of the ingredients used in making it has some good property to
                keep you fit and healthy as mint has inflammation property and rava is used for weight loss and it does
                not make pani puri heavy to eat and cause stomach problems.You can burn these calories through a lot of

                available to buy and eat.
                In North India, panipuri is known as golgappa, gol referring to the crispy shell, and gappa referring to
                the eating process, since these small snacks are typically eaten one at a time. It is believed that
                panipuri originated in Uttar Pradesh and gradually spread in popularity throughout the country and
                outside of it.Pani Puris have a famous name, which is Golgappe because it is round in sphere shape. They
                are made from flour, rava, soda, and water. After some time, ghee is also used for deep frying them.They
                are made in large numbers then it could be easily be stored in a big-sized container. They are crispy
                and crunchy Puchka stuffed with so many ingredients. Pani puris are rich in dietary fibers as they help
                in the reduction of cardiovascular problems, patients going through diabetic issues and blood sugar.
                Today, panipuri stalls are a staple at most fairs, festivals, or weddings in India.</p>

            <h3 id="p1">Panner</h3>
            <p>Paneer, also known as ponir or Indian cottage cheese, is a fresh acid-set cheese common in the Indian
                subcontinent
                made from cow or buffalo milk. It is a non-aged, non-melting soft cheese made by curdling milk with
                a fruit-
                or vegetable-derived acid, such as lemon juice. Paneer is a South Asian (mostly Indian) soft cheese
                variety manufactured from cow or buffalo milk or combination thereof, by combined acid (sour milk,
                lactic acid, or citric acid) and heat coagulation of milk. Good quality Paneer is characterized by a
                marble white color, sweet, mildly acid taste, nutty flavor, spongy body, and closely knit, smooth
                texture (Khan and Pal, 2011). According the Bureau of Indian Standards (Khan and Pal, 2011; Kumar et
                al., 2014), Paneer contains a maximum of 60% moisture and minimum of 50% fat in dry matter. Milk solids
                may also be used in preparation of Paneer.

                Paneer is used in a variety of forms, such as, base for variety of culinary dishes, ingredient for
                ethnic Indian cuisine (e.g., matar paneer and palak paneer). The ability of Paneer to be deep fried
                without losing its shape is one feature that has led to its wide acceptance and a favorite for making
                snacks, pakoras, or fried paneer chunks (Khan and Pal, 2011).

                Buffalo milk is considered more suitable than cow milk for making good quality Paneer because it
                contains higher concentration of fat, caseins, and minerals (calcium, phosphorus), which impart a firm
                and rubbery body to buffalo milk paneer (Ghodekar, 1989). In addition, the lower voluminosity and
                solvation of casein micelles in buffalo milk gives buffalo milk paneer a spongy texture. The typical
                fat:SNF ratio in buffalo milk for the manufacture of Paneer is 1:1.65 (Khan and Pal, 2011; Kumar et al.,
                2014) whereas cow milk containing 3.5%–5.0% fat have been successfully used for Paneer (Kumar et al.,
                2014).

                Although Paneer is traditionally made from buffalo milk, good quality Paneer can be obtained from cow’s
                milk. Heat treatment of milk at 90°C for 10–15 min is necessary to achieve desired yield (Chandan,
                2007). The concentration of coagulant (acid) affects the body and texture of Paneer. For example,
                coagulating acid diluted to 2% gives Paneer a soft body and texture compared to acid diluted to 5%,
                which gives Paneer a hard body. The amount of dilute acid required for coagulation of milk depends upon
                the type of milk, buffering capacity of milk, type of coagulant, and the coagulation temperature.

                The temperature and pH of coagulation have a significant effect on the body and texture, TS recovery and
                yield of Paneer. The optimum temperature of coagulation differs for different types of milk and their
                composition. Coagulation temperature influences moisture retention in Paneer. Increasing coagulation
                temperature from 60 to 90°C decreases the moisture content of Paneer from 59.0 to 49.0%. Paneer obtained
                by coagulating milk at 70°C has the best organoleptic quality and most desired frying quality and
                softness (Chandan, 2007; Sachdeva and Singh, 1988)

                Variation in the pH of coagulation has a significant effect on the body and texture, flavor, quality,
                and yield of Paneer. When the coagulation pH is lowered from pH 5.5 to 5.0, the moisture content and
                yield of Paneer decreases (De, 1980; Sachdeva and Singh, 1988). However, Vishweshwaraiah and
                Anantakrishnan (1985) reported that Paneer made from cows’ milk coagulated at pH 5.0 had superior
                sensory quality compared to that coagulated at pH 5.5. The moisture content and yield of Paneer
                increased from 50 to 58.6% and from 20.8 to 24.8% respectively, when coagulation pH increased from 5.1
                to 5.4. Sensory quality for Paneer made from buffalo milk was best when coagulation was at pH 5.3–5.35
                (Sachdeva and Singh, 1988). For Paneer made from cow’s milk, Sachdeva et al. (1991) found that the best
                sensory attributes occurred when coagulation occurred at pH 5.20–5.25. Mistry et al. (1992) studied the
                effects of added calcium sulfate (0.02 or 0.05%) or disodium hydrogen phosphate (0.02 and 0.05%) on
                Paneer made from milk heated at 82°C and found that the best sensory scores of raw (uncooked) paneer
                were achieved with 0.05% calcium phosphate whereas fried paneer containing 0.02% calcium phosphate had
                the best sensory scores.</p>
